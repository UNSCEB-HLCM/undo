# Iteration 1: motivating scenario

## Name

Relations between documents published by the United Nation (UN)


## Description

The documents published by the United Nation (normative documents, legal documents, etc.) are full of references to real-world objects and concepts, such as documents, people, organisations, legal terms, roles, etc. Such entities are clearly linked with the actual content of the document, even by means of different terms, since UN documents are written in six different languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish. 

These relations between entities are, thus, defined by the document content, and typically can concern at least one of the following layers:

1. document-oriented layer, which allows the creation of direct links from the current version of the document to other relevant entities that are mentioned there;
2. entity-oriented layer, which enables the identification of entities cited in the document content (e.g. organisations) acting with other relevant entities (people, events, organizations, etc.);
3. content-oriented layer, which provides a specific semantics to all the terms identified in the document content.
 
The document (or any of its parts) can be explicitly annotated by someone with all these relations in order to create a formal connection between the text and the entities its introduces.


## Example 1

In the preface of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996 there are references to: 

1. the UN resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. the Government of Turkey;
3. the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).


## Example 2

According to the content of the UN resolution A/RES/50/100 of 2 February 1996, the General Assembly:

1. recalls the resolution A/RES/47/180 of 22 December 1992;
2. reiterates its gratitude to the Government of Turkey;
3. notes the progress that has been made so far in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).


## Example 3

The UN resolution A/RES/50/100 has been published in six different languages. The term "decides" has been used twice in the English version, and, in parallel, the term "decide" has been used twice in the Spanish version. Both the terms actually refers to the same higher-level concept of taking a decision, even if this aspect has not been made formally explicit in the document itself.
