# Iteration 3: motivating scenario

## Name

Document workflow


## Description

Keeping track of the processes concerning the creation and modification of documents is a crucial task to address in the legal and legislative domain. Each of these processes, commonly called workflow, is actually composed by a sequence of steps. Each step is responsible to produce some outputs (e.g. a review) starting from some inputs (e.g. a document). 

Workflows can be described from two different points of view. On the one hand, there is the declaration of the workflow schema, or simply the workflow, which is how a specific process (e.g. the publication of a document) is actually organised in sequential steps. Each step can have a specific type (e.g. write, review, revise), it can involve different kinds of actors, and it finally produces a particular output. On the other hand, each execution of a workflow is a specific entity per se, it is usually composed by sets of actions, and each set of actions is addressing a particular step defined in the workflow in consideration.


## Example 1

The publication of a document should go through four phases, or steps: 

1. writing, which will produce a document;
2. review, that will produce comments starting from the input document;
3. revision, that will produce a new version of the previous document corrected considering the comments produced by the previous step; 
4. publication, which will assign the "published" status to that document. 


## Example 2

The Assistant of the Italian Representative writes the first draft of a resolution from the 1st of March 2017 to the 5th of March 2017. On the 7th of March, the Italian Representative revises it, and extends the introduction. From the 9th of March to the 10th of March, Assistant of the Italian Representative finalises the document. On the 11th of March, the State Member Italy makes it available for review.

On the 12th of March, the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly read the draft. From the 13th of March to the 20th of March, the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly writes a comment highlighting issues. The comment is then made available to the President of the General Assembly on the 21st of March.

From the 22nd to the 27th of March, the Committee Number 1 revises the draft and addresses the main issues raised by the Office of the Presidency of the General Assembly. On the 28th, the draft is sent to the General Assembly.

The General Assembly approves and publishes the resolution on the 31st of March.
