# Iteration 2: motivating scenario

## Name

Roles, status, and other context-dependent values


## Description

Several kinds of objects can be involved in situations describing them as holding a certain value associated for a specific interval or according to a specific concept. For instance, agents having a particular role (e.g. being the president of the Italy from 2006 to 2015) or documents holding particular status (e.g. a document that has been under-review from September 2016 to October 2016) in a specific time and/or related to a particular context are examples for these situations.

These kinds of scenarios involve at least four specific kinds of entities:
* the entity holding such value (e.g. an agent or a document);
* the value held (e.g. a role or a status);
* the time defining when such value is held (e.g. from 2006 to 2015);
* the context to which the scenario applies (Italy).


## Example 1

Giorgio Napolitano has been President of Italy for the first time from the 15th of May 2006 to the 22th of April 2013, when he resigned. He has been elected again on the 22th of April 2013, and he has been President of Italy for the second time by the 14th of January 2015, when he resigned for the second time. He has been substituted by Sergio Mattarella, who starts his mandate as President of Italy on the 3rd of February 2015, formerly judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy from the 11th of October 2011 to the 2nd of February 2015.


## Example 2

A document has been in drafting from the 14th of May to the 14th of June 2016. Then, it has been under revision for the following two months, and finally published on the 1st of September 2016.
